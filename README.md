## Preparation Strategy

- Focus on mastering key data structures such as **arrays, stacks, trees, linked lists, queues, graphs**, and **union-find**.
- Implement **DFS** and **BFS** to solve problems related to tree and graph traversal.
- Practice problems that require optimization of algorithms, such as **dynamic programming, greedy algorithms**, and **divide and conquer**.
- Solve **system design** problems to prepare for large-scale system design interviews.
